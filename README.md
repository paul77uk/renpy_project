# renpy_project

Please download Ren'Py and download these files. Make a file inside renpy called CORONAVIRUS STRIKE and put in all .rpy or .txt files. Put all images in images folder.
It should work.

A maybe easier way,

Create a game called CORONAVIRUS STRIKE! in Ren'Py by clicking "+Create New Project", at the bottom. Then, replace the old script to the script in these files, and replace the options files
with the new option file in these files. Then put all .png files ing the images area, and it should work.

Sorry for the complicatedness-- it works on my computer, but I didn't know how to publish my files.
